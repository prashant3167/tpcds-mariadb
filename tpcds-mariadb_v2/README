Toolbox for TPC-DS on MariaDB
=============================

This repository is a toolbox for TPC-DS benchmark[1] execution on MariaDB.  The
tools help modifying, building, and running TPC-DS kit source code for MariaDB.


Pre-requisites
==============

You should get TPC-DS kit source code before using the tools.  You can download
it from TPC website[2] as a zip file after agree to their license.


Versions
========

This toolbox is tested for TPC-DS tools v2.5.0rc2 and MariaDB 10.2.8, the
latest version as of this writing.


Limitations
===========

TPC-DS has 99 queries for performance test.  However, some queries use SQL
keywords that MariaDB doesn't support.  Our tools just ignore such queries on
power test.  As a result, we use only 49 queries for power test.


Quick Start
===========

This section describes simple steps for TPC-DS test setup and execution.  Every
example assumes that your current working directory is this repository.


Extract TPC-DS Toolkit Source Code
----------------------------------

```
$ ./extract_src.sh <path to your zip file>
```


Modify TPC-DS kit Code
----------------------

```
$ ./patch-tpcds-kit.sh
```


Build TPC-DS Kit
----------------

```
$ ./build.sh
```


Generate Data
-------------

```
$ ./datgen.sh <scale factor>
```


Execute Load Test
-----------------

Before next command, you should start mysqld daemon.  Next command assumes that
your mysqld has user `root` without password.  In other words, it should be
able to use `$ mysql -u root` to connect to MariaDB prompt.
```
$ ./loadtest.sh <scale factor>
```


Execute Power Test
------------------

```
$ ./mkqueries.sh <scale factor>
$ ./powertest.sh
```


Execute Query 2 Only
--------------------

```
$ ./mkqueries.sh <scale factor>
$ ./runquery.sh 2
```
